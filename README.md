# Luoshuangs-GPULightmass-5.3-preview
Due to problems with the latest updates to this repository were causing errors. 

I have had to take this online version down until I have a fix which until I can find and fix the problem which may mean at least July 2023
Please use the UE 5.1.1 version.

I explained previously that there will NOT be a 5.2 version from me as the Market Creators have asked to put effort in 5.3
